## Overview

### The challenge

The Austin Animal Shelter is looking to gather some important details from their data. They have three tables worth of data detailing the incoming and outgoing animals that theyâ€™d like you to analyze.

I'll complete this challenge by utilizing my knowledge of Pandas to gather the information the shelter is requesting.

## My process

### Built with

- Basic Python with Pandas within a Jupyter Notebooks

### What I learned

In this project, I was able to practice my Analytical skills with a couple large Datasets. I practiced my ability to answer questions that resulted in me providing and explaining my answers to potential client. I also learned that with Jupyter Notebooks, you can have a fully loaded environment to practice on all while remaining inside the browser.

### Continued development

I'll continue with the Data Analytic Tech Degree from Team Treehouse and will continue to build my Data Analytical skillset with the hopes of being able to break into the Data career field.
